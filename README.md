## Project Structure

### 1. **Variables & Data Types**
- File: [1-Variables & Data Types .md] (c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Dart%20language/1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%BA%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA%20%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B9%20Variables%20&%20Data%20Types%20.md)
- Contains an explanation of basic Dart data types such as `int`, `double`, String, bool, lists, and sets.
- Practical examples of how to declare and use variables.

---

### 2. Loops
- File: [for,while,do-while loops.md] (c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Dart%20language/for,while,do-while%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AA%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%87%20.md)
- Covers loop types such as for, while, and do-while.
- Practical examples of using loops with lists and maps.
- A detailed explanation of functions like `forEach` and `Iterable.generate`.

---

### 3. **Algorithms**
- Folder: [Algorithms](c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Dart%20language/Algorithms/)
- Contains several files covering common algorithms such as:
- Search algorithms (BFS, DFS).
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford).
- Network algorithms (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp).
- Text algorithms (Manacher's Algorithm, Z-Algorithm).
- Binary tree algorithms.
- Practical examples with explanations for each algorithm.

### 4. **Exception Handling**
- File: [Exception Handling.md] (c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Dart%20language/Exception%20Handling%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%84%20%D9%85%D8%B9%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%A1%20.md)
- Explanation of how to handle errors using `try-catch` and `finally`.
- Examples of creating custom exceptions.
- Detailed explanation of common error types such as `FormatException`.

---

### 5. **Data Structures**
- Folders:
- [Arrr](c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Dart%20language/Arrr/)
- [oop](c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Dart%20language/oop/)
- Contains practical examples of data structures such as lists, sets, and maps.
- A detailed explanation of how to create and use custom data structures.
