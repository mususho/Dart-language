# Dart Language Learning Project

## Project Description
This project contains a comprehensive set of educational files that explain the concepts and fundamentals of the Dart programming language. The project aims to provide educational content covering various topics related to Dart, from variables and types to algorithms, to error handling and advanced data structures.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Variables & Data Types**
- File: [1-Variables & Data Types .md] 
- Contains an explanation of basic Dart data types such as `int`, `double`, String, bool, lists, and sets.
- Practical examples of how to declare and use variables.

---

### 2. Loops
- File: [for,while,do-while loops.md]
- Covers loop types such as for, while, and do-while.
- Practical examples of using loops with lists and maps.
- A detailed explanation of functions like `forEach` and `Iterable.generate`.

---

### 3. **Algorithms**
- Folder: [Algorithms](c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Dart%20language/Algorithms/)
- Contains several files covering common algorithms such as:
- Search algorithms (BFS, DFS).
- Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford).
- Network algorithms (Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp).
- Text algorithms (Manacher's Algorithm, Z-Algorithm).
- Binary tree algorithms.
- Practical examples with explanations for each algorithm.

---

### 4. **Exception Handling**
- File: [Exception Handling.md] 
- Explanation of how to handle errors using `try-catch` and `finally`.
- Examples of creating custom exceptions.
- Detailed explanation of common error types such as `FormatException`.

---

### 5. **Data Structures**
- Folders:
- [Array](c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Dart%20language/Array/)
- [oop](c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/Dart%20language/oop/)
- Contains practical examples of data structures such as lists, sets, and maps.
- A detailed explanation of how to create and use custom data structures.

---

## Features
- **Comprehensive Organization:** The files are organized by topic for easy learning.
- **Practical Examples:** Each topic contains practical examples written in Dart.
- **Extensive Coverage:** The project covers topics from the basics to advanced topics such as algorithms and data structures.
